        <h2>U.S. Embassy in Nepal (by Amanda Jacobson, (Cultural Affairs Officer)</h2>
        <p>
          The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Nepal programmed Ms. Farhana Shah with
          the State Department's U.S. Speaker program in 2011. Over the course of ten days Ms. Shah
          gave teacher training workshops on enhancing instruction techniques, curriculum development,
          leadership skills, classroom management, and effective implementation of extracurricular
          activities to teachers in Kathmandu and Nepalgunj. Ms. Shah also gave two sessions at the
          international Nepal English Language Teachers' Association's annual conference in Kathmandu
          and Pokhara. In addition, Ms. Shah gave public presentations to youth, students, teachers, and
          community leaders on a variety of topics related to U.S. society, culture, and education. Her
          programs impacted more than 300 individuals in total. Ms. Shah is knowledgeable, experienced,
          and passionate about her subject matter. Participants were extremely impressed by the quality
          and usefulness of the material presented, and Ms. Shah's personalized delivery method.
