        <p>Letter of Recommendation for Farhana Shah</p>
        <p>March 10, 2011</p>
        <p>
          The Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy in Nepal programmed Ms. Farhana Shah, a Staff Development Teacher of Montgomery Country Public Schools with the State Department's U.S. Speaker program from February 13 â€” 22, 2011. Over the course of ten days Ms. Shah gave teacher training workshops on enhancing instruction techniques, curriculum development, leadership skills, classroom management, and effective implementation of extracurricular activities to teachers in Kathmandu and Nepalgunj. Ms. Shah also gave two sessions at the international Nepal English Language Teachers' Association's annual conference in Kathmandu and Pokhara. In addition, Ms. Shah gave public presentations to youth, students, teachers, and community leaders on a variety of topics related to U.S. society, culture, and education. Her command of the Urdu language was extremely useful in the programs outside of Kathmandu, enabling her to intimately connect with her audiences. Her programs impacted more than 300 individuals in total.

          After seeing Ms. Shah in action for ten days, I highly recommend her as an educator and presenter. Ms. Shah is knowledgeable, experienced, and passionate about her subject matter. She came to Nepal extremely well prepared for her various audiences, with over six useful separate Power Point presentations on a variety of teacher training topics. Participants were extremely impressed by the quality and usefulness of the material presented, and Ms. Shah's personalized delivery method. She is a truly gifted educator. In addition, Ms. Shah has stayed in contact with several teachers that she met at her training workshops in Nepal and currently serves as a mentor to them via email. She stated that she plans to invite them to her blogsite to provide them with teaching resources and on-going support.
