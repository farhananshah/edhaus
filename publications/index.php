        <h2>Making Classrooms More Inclusive for Muslim Students</h2>
        <p>
          Educators have a tremendous responsibility in ensuring all students are safe from maliciousness and hate. In our current climate there is a disturbing trend of Islamophobia that may not be addressed in schools. The rise and spread of Islamophobia are generating a different landscape for Muslim children growing up today. Anti-Muslim rhetoric and attitudes are dangerous in schools. Students are often made to feel unwelcome by constantly being asked where they are from or being complimented on their well-spoken English or young being labeled as terrorists.

        <h2>American Muslim students need understanding and support</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine if you were a Muslim student in your school. What would it be like for you in this time of Islamophobia? As an educator, ask yourself what you know about the Muslim students in your school and district, and what you can do to alleviate the situation to make all students comfortable and ready to learn.
