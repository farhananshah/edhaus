Over the course of ten days Ms. Shah gave teacher training workshops on enhancing instruction techniques, curriculum development, leadership skills, classroom management, and effective implementation of extracurricular activities to teachers in Kathmandu and Nepalgunj. Ms. Shah also gave two sessions at the international Nepal English Language Teachers' Association's annual conference in Kathmandu and Pokhara. In addition, Ms. Shah gave public presentations to youth, students, teachers, and community leaders on a variety of topics related to U.S. society, culture, and education. Her command of the Urdu language was extremely useful in the programs outside of Kathmandu, enabling her to intimately connect with her audiences. Her programs impacted more than 300 individuals in total.</i>"
