      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Edhaus strives to empower and educate leaders in educational institutions
        and schools by offering training and professional development for their
        staff. Educational institutions are being charged with demands at all
        levels, in-person and online. In addition, they are expected to keep up
        with new research and effective practices. Edhaus can be a support
        because we know professional development is a key in meeting needs of
        today’s increasing demands for teaching and learning. We also provide
        customized trainings and workshops to clients outside of educational
        institutes on topics related to building effective teams, management, and
        Diversity and inclusion (to name a few).
